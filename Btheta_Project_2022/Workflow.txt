Workflow for setting up notebook to work with Megan's B theta model:

1. Download model iAH991 as JSON from this Narrative: https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/84574

2. Remove duplicate compound (ggdp_c0) and convert to SBML, saving as .xml. Use notebook Convert_Model_JSON_to_SBML.

3. Re-upload model to KBase workspace as iAH991.xml_model.

4. Use notebook KBase_Cobrapy_Integration to get model from workspace and work with it in cobrapy. For prerequisites to get this integration to work, read SettingUpNotebooks_01_2021. Remember that periodically you will have to create a new developer token and save it in the right place in order to access KBase models with the notebook.
